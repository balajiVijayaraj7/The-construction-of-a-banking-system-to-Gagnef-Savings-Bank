# Gagnef Savings Bank System Project Documentation

## Introduction
This repository documents the creation of the Gagnef Savings Bank's banking system. It covers the design and implementation of a database system intended for bank operations, crafted with meticulous attention to academic rigor and industry standards.

## Project Overview
The project showcases a robust implementation of a banking system using Oracle's PL/SQL. It includes table definitions, account management, transaction processing, and integrity constraints that adhere to the bank's operational requirements.

## Implementation Details
- Defined essential database tables for customers, account types, transactions, etc.
- Enforced referential integrity and implemented primary and foreign keys.
- Developed triggers for maintaining consistent and valid data states after operations such as deposits, withdrawals, and transfers.
- Created procedures for customer creation, transaction processing, and balance inquiries, ensuring secure and efficient data manipulation.
- Implemented functions for login verification and authority checks, critical for secure banking operations.

## Testing
Comprehensive tests were written and executed to validate all functionalities, from customer creation to complex transaction scenarios, ensuring system reliability and performance under various conditions.

## Usage
The system is documented with clear instructions for setup, operation, and testing, allowing for easy replication and demonstration of the banking system's capabilities.

## Conclusion
This project serves as a testament to my ability to design and implement a complex database system with transactional capabilities. It stands as a demonstration of my technical skills in SQL, PL/SQL, database design, and secure software development practices.
